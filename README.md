*Note that if you have problems in shooting , it's because the particle effects are in .gitignore

Health pool & grey zone only work when there are more than one player ( due to SerializeView )

the switching mech buttons in hangar work and the datas are save in game

The respawn panel also work and can switch different mechs

All bugs found in hangar have been fixed

Leteen is working on sword animations 

Spear will be imported when the animations are finished

Penetrating into the ground bug has been fixed

Everything turning red bug is due to changing animations on instantiated object on runtime

Problem :
lag compensation

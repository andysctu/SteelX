This package contains example models for Rigify to Unity (http://u3d.as/content/edelweiss-interactive/rigify-to-unity/1RJ).

There are two models. They were named, such that one of them is handled by the Rigify to Unity post processor (Gus Rigify). The other one is identical, but does not contain 'Rigify' in the name, such that is is not processed and has all the unneeded bones and meshes. Like that you can easily have a look at the effect of Rigify to Unity.

Keep in mind that those are just example files. The model was made within a very short amount of time, with the goal to present an example. As a result, all artistic aspects are not good! You have to see it as a technical demo.
